//Desc: School() is the default constructor
//Pre: none 
//Post: the member variables are filled with default values 

//Desc: School() is the specified constructor
//Pre: passes in a positive grid size (only one value since its a square)
//Post: member variable name is filled in with a user defined value 

//Desc: all set functions take in a value and set the private member variable to that value 
//Pre: a value must be passed in 
//Post: the member variable is now assigned the new value 

//Desc: get functions return a private member variable's value 
//Pre: pass in an x and y coord within the size of the array  
//Post: returned a the char at that spot 

//Desc: print_whole() prints out the entire grid with the right formatting 
//Pre: none 
//Post: the grid is printed 

//Desc: build_arr() creates the bare grid without all of the lines and dashes, it doesnt include the J and C
//Pre: none 
//Post: the array is filled with the basic grid 

//Desc: set_jan() changes the value of the array where the janitor is to be placed   
//Pre: find an x and y coord that is open and pass in the character to represent the janitor 
//Post: 'J' is placed in the array where the x and y specify 

//Desc: set_lunch() chnages the value of the array where the lunch is to be placed   
//Pre: find an x and y coord that is open and pass the character to represent the lunch 
//Post: 'J' is placed in the array where the x and y specify
